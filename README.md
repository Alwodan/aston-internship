# Little overview
Super simple arraylist implementation with sorting supported.  
Supports two sorting methods, maybe will add some later.  
  
QuickSort method is chosen by default, you can change it by creating and inserting sorter via setSorter() method.  
  
Maybe after I add some more sorters I will make some constants with them for easier insertions.
